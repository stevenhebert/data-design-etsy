			<h1>purpose, audience, & goal</h1> This project is a retail platform focused on the retailers experience. The
			site will offer a venue for sellers of unique goods to connect with their niche buyers. The goal of the project
			is to establish a retail-home catered to the craft enthusiast. The typical seller is not soley interested in
			profit, nor is the typical buyer necessarily interested in the best value.



			<h1>persona</h1>

			<h2>profession</h2> Seller profile for producer of hair-ables <em>"hair-wearables"</em> made from donated canine
			trimmings. this unique individual is is an ethical purveyor of cosmetic and beauty-enhancing items. seller is
			adamant about conveying this information to buyers.

			<h2>technology</h2> Although an expert in her field, user is technologically inept; she's easily frustrated by
			technological barriers. Is able to navigate a computer with little assistance and is capable of
			recording/capturing media with her mobile device.

			<h2>attitude/behavior</h2> Seller has an open schedule which she prefers not to spend wrestling with computer
			problems.

			<h2>frustration/needs</h2> Seller needs a platform that is easy to navigate and provides easy access
			to technical support. The seller desires a store front that is polished and showcases her items. Item listings
			should offer a variety of ways to convey product information, production details and materials, and shipping
			and return policies. The platform should be accessible to an international audience, accept a variety of
			payment options, as well as provide performance metrics.

			<h2>goals</h2> The seller needs an incentive to choose this site over competing platforms (e.g., eBay, Amazon).
			She needs a retail venue oriented towards custom, one-off goods, not mass-produced goods. This should be the
			first destination both buyers and sellers think of for this type of item.

			<h2>user story</h2> As a retailer, I need a no-hassle experience to market my goods to an international audience.



			<h1>use case:</h1> A number of buyers have sent payments for the sellers items. A handful of potential buyers
			have inquired about the specifics regarding the sellers items.

			The seller prepares her orders for pickup by USPS. After packaging the items she updates the status of her
			orders and uploads tracking information for the buyers. She then responds to her inquiries and checks her
			inventory.

			While out shopping at hobby lobby she sell a couple more items. Her receives this notification via the etsy
			mobile application and restocks her supplies.



			<h1>interaction flow</h1>

			<h2>profile creation</h2> Seller must first register a profile; the individual may use a linked service
			that can provide registration information.

			<h2>shop creation</h2> Seller chooses a shop name.

			<h2>item listing</h2> After the shop is established, the interface provides fields for
			the seller to specify item category, search tags, item description, production process/materials,
			provide photos, list quantity offered, customization, shipping and return policies.
