			site will offer a venue for sellers of unique goods to connect with their niche buyers. The goal of the project
			is to establish a retail-home catered to the craft enthusiast. The typical seller is not soley interested in
			profit, nor is the typical buyer necessarily interested in the best value.

			trimmings. this unique individual is is an ethical purveyor of cosmetic and beauty-enhancing items. seller is
			adamant about conveying this information to buyers.

			technological barriers. Is able to navigate a computer with little assistance and is capable of
			recording/capturing media with her mobile device.

			and return policies. The platform should be accessible to an international audience, accept a variety of
			payment options, as well as provide performance metrics.

			destination both sellers and buyers think of when searching for these types of crafts and services.

			that can provide registration information.

			the seller to specify item category, search tags, describe the item, production process/materials,
			provide photos, list quantity offered, customization options, shipping and return policies.
